The scripts for generating the morphospaces (01.morphospace.R), the DTT plots (02.DTT_wholetree.R), the rate analyses (03.rates.R), the DTT plots over 100 posterior trees (04.DTT_100sample.R), and the time series analyses (05.Time_series.R) are included. 

The 'data' folder containts all the data needed for running the scripts, namely:
- cond.tre = consensus tree file from Coiro et al. (2023).
- sample100 = sample of 100 trees from the posterior sample of Coiro et al. (2023).
- Matrix_20230214 = morphological matrix.
- FADLAD.csv = FADLAD data for the tip-only analysis.
- timeseries.csv = data for the time series analysis, including bootstrap median data for sum of variance and median centroid distance, Temperature, and CO2.

The 'data' folder also containts a nexus version of the Morphological matrix with characters annotated and readable by Mesquite (Matrix_ann_20230214)
